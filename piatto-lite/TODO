= Add an index to raw/ =

The idea would be that opening raw, the code would open raw/certs.index with namelen/name/offset/len for each cert and update it at the end.

When loading the first raw/certs/?
 - look for raw/certs.index
   => if it exists, load the data
   => if it does not, rebuild the index with rebuild_index (which is essentially what we do now)
 - do as before

When adding a file raw/certs/? that does not exist
 - remove raw/certs.index.bak if it existed
 - rename raw/certs.index raw/certs.index.bak
 - mark certs as dirty
 - do as before

When closing all
 - for each dirty filetype
 - rewrite the index
 - remove raw/certs.index.bak


This would allow for
 - better perfs
 - a clear update path
 - a way to list all certs easily

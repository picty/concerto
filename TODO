= TODO in concerto-ng =
 - Sort this TODO!
 - Add some features to fileOps (see TODO inside)
 - Write a clean merge
 - Add inject-db.sh
 - Rewrite piccolo
 - Add options for parseCerts (-out-prefix) and for merge (-in-prefix) to allow parallel tools on the same directory
 - Find a way to annotate stuff (trust info on certs and chains and IPs) => the SQL db ?

 - Write gradeChains
 - Write tools to handle trust
   * annotate-trust cert
   * propagate-trust (certs/chains)


= Add an index to raw/ =

The idea would be that opening raw, the code would open raw/certs.index with namelen/name/offset/len for each cert and update it at the end.

When loading the first raw/certs/?
 - look for raw/certs.index
   => if it exists, load the data
   => if it does not, rebuild the index with rebuild_index (which is essentially what we do now)
 - do as before

When adding a file raw/certs/? that does not exist
 - remove raw/certs.index.bak if it existed
 - rename raw/certs.index raw/certs.index.bak
 - mark certs as dirty
 - do as before

When closing all
 - for each dirty filetype
 - rewrite the index
 - remove raw/certs.index.bak


This would allow for
 - better perfs
 - a clear update path
 - a way to list all certs easily


= Add a R ^ W for dumped files ? =






Campaigns
 - Proper support for multiple A records when resolving names
 - Add tools to probe a list (adapt probe_server)
 - Add tools to extract IPs and names from a database, possibly subject to some conditions (campaign id)

AnswerDump -> CSV
 - Handle warning-level "Unrecognized name" alerts preceding valid handshake messages

scans.io -> CSV
 - Add support for files from scans.io (_hosts + _certs)

DB injection
 - Allow for DB reuse (with different campaign ids)
 - New tool to check DB internal consistency (should be replaced by real constraints?)
 - Allow for different back-ends (sqlite, pgsql)

Analysis -> DB injection
 - Add support for revocation
 - Add support for arbitrary trust anchors (at rendering level)
 - Add support for name constraints (and the possibility to add them in the db)

Website
 - Provide French templates (using cookies to retain the language?)
 - Add support for redirect for one cert/one chain
   (certs/by-hash/0c -> certs/by-hash/0c543534...) and try to make it work with the statification
 - Add support to filter by campaign
 - Add support to only show certain parts of the HTML and/or limit the depth of the queries
 - Use Bootstrap to render the results properly

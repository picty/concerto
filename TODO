Analysis -> DB injection
 - Allow for progressive enrichment (links, revocation, chains)

   is valid or not (and also the reason, to avoid complicated research with the raw data)

 - Add support for name constraints (and the possibility to add them in the db)

Website
 - Provide French templates (using cookies to retain the language?)

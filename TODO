Campaigns
 - Proper support for multiple A records when resolving names
 - Add tools to probe a list (adapt probe_server)

AnswerDump -> CSV
 - Do not analyse links and chains too early

scans.io -> CSV
 - Add support for files from scans.io (_hosts + _certs)

DB injection
 - Allow for DB reuse (with different campaign ids)
 - New tool to check DB internal consistency (should be replaced by real constraints?)
 - Allow for different back-ends (sqlite, pgsql)

Analysis -> DB injection
 - Allow for progressive enrichment (links, revocation, chains)
 - links table should contain all possible links (subject/issuer) and states wheteher the link
   is valid or not (and also the reason, to avoid complicated research with the raw data)

Website

   (certs/by-hash/0c -> certs/by-hash/0c543534...) and try to make it work with the statification
 - Add support to filter by campaign
 - Add support to only show certain parts of the HTML and/or limit the depth of the queries

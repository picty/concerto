Concerto: a set of tools to extract, analyse and browse certificates and chains:
 - piatto, a Parsifal-based tool to extract certificates from answer dumps

 - chitarra, an OCaml tool to enrich data in the database

 - piccolo, a web server in Python/Flask to present the result
 - fagotto, a program to produce report

 - maestro, to wrap it up


Currently, we need to call some programs one after the other:
 - piatto-lite (*.dump -> answers.csv + chains.csv + raw/ [certs])
 - merge-certs (certs */raw)
 - parseCerts (certs/* -> certs.csv + dns.csv + names.csv + unparsed.csv
 - prepareLinks [Needs to see the whole certs.csv!]
